## Architecture Overview
{
  "high_level_system_architecture_diagram": "The system consists of a web application frontend, an OCR processing microservice, and a database for storing processed results. The frontend allows users to upload images, which are sent to the OCR service for processing. The results are then returned to the frontend for display.",
  "core_components": {
    "frontend": "Web application built with Flask/Django for user interaction.",
    "ocr_service": "Microservice utilizing Tesseract or Google Cloud Vision for OCR processing.",
    "database": "Storage for images and extracted text, using SQLite or PostgreSQL."
  },
  "data_flow_and_control_flow": "User uploads an image via the frontend -> Image is sent to the OCR service -> OCR service processes the image and returns extracted text -> Frontend displays the results.",
  "integration_points": {
    "frontend_to_ocr_service": "REST API for image upload and text retrieval.",
    "ocr_service_to_database": "Database connection for storing and retrieving processed data."
  },
