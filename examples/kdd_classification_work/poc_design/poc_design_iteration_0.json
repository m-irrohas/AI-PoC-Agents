    "overview": {
      "high_level_system_architecture_diagram": "The architecture consists of three main components: Data Preprocessing Module, Model Training Module, and Evaluation Module. Data flows from the KDD Cup 99 dataset into the Data Preprocessing Module, which cleans and transforms the data. The processed data is then fed into the Model Training Module, where ensemble learning algorithms (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) are applied. Finally, the Evaluation Module assesses the model's performance using various metrics.",

        "Data Preprocessing Module": "Cleans and normalizes the dataset, outputs processed data.",
        "Model Training Module": "Receives processed data, trains models, outputs trained models.",
        "Evaluation Module": "Receives trained models and test data, outputs evaluation metrics."
      },
      "data_flow_and_control_flow": "Data flows from the KDD dataset to the Data Preprocessing Module, then to the Model Training Module, and finally to the Evaluation Module. Control flow is managed by a main script that orchestrates the sequence of operations.",
      "integration_points_and_interfaces": "The modules communicate through function calls and shared data structures. The Evaluation Module can also expose an API endpoint for external access to evaluation results.",
      "deployment_architecture": "The system will be deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS or Azure) using Docker containers for each module to ensure isolation and scalability."
