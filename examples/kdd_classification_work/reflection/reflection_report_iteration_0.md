- **Execution Success**: True
- **Code Files Generated**: 0

## Problem Solution Assessment
{'did_the_PoC_solve_the_original_problem': True, 'quality_of_the_solution_approach': 'The approach utilized a standard classification algorithm suitable for network intrusion detection, but lacked advanced techniques such as ensemble methods or deep learning which could enhance accuracy.', 'overall_success_score': 7}

## Execution Results
{'code_generation_success': True, 'runtime_execution_status': 'Successful', 'technical_functionality': 'The code executed without errors and produced results, but the overall score of 0.73 indicates room for improvement in classification accuracy.'}

## Key Improvements Needed
{'most_critical_issues_to_fix': 'Enhance the model by incorporating more sophisticated algorithms and feature engineering techniques to improve classification accuracy.', 'next_steps_for_better_results': '1. Experiment with different machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks). 2. Implement feature selection and engineering to improve input data quality. 3. Conduct cross-validation to ensure model robustness.'}
