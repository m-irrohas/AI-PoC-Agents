# PoC Design Document

## Architecture Overview
The OCR image recognition system will consist of a command-line application that processes images, extracts text using OCR technology, and outputs the recognized text. The system will leverage a modular architecture with components for image preprocessing, text extraction, and result presentation.

## System Components
- Image Preprocessing Module
- OCR Engine
- Result Formatter
- Performance Logger

## Technology Stack


## Data Flow
Images are input into the system, processed for noise reduction and normalization, passed to the OCR engine for text extraction, and finally formatted and logged for output.

## Implementation Phases
1. Phase 1: Setup Development Environment
2. Phase 2: Implement Image Preprocessing Module
3. Phase 3: Integrate OCR Engine
4. Phase 4: Develop Result Formatter and Logger
5. Phase 5: Testing and Validation
6. Phase 6: Documentation and Demonstration Preparation

## Performance Requirements
- accuracy: At least 90% accuracy in text recognition
- processing_time: Under 5 seconds per image

## Demo Scenarios
- User inputs a sample image of handwritten notes
- System processes the image and outputs recognized text
- Performance metrics are displayed after processing

## Success Criteria
- Achieve at least 90% accuracy in text recognition
- Process images in under 5 seconds
- Positive user feedback on usability and accuracy
