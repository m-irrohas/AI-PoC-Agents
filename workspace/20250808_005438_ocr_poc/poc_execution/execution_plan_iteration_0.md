# PoC Execution Plan

## Setup Steps
1. Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is installed on your machine.
2. Create a new directory for the OCR project.
3. Navigate to the project directory.

## Installation Commands
```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install easyocr
pip install numpy
pip install pillow
```

## Execution Commands
1. Navigate to the project directory containing 'main.py'.
2. Run the command: python main.py
3. Check the console output for any errors or logs.

## Validation Tests
- Test with a variety of image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP) to ensure compatibility.
- Measure the accuracy of text recognition using known text images.
- Test processing time for each image to ensure it is under 5 seconds.
- Simulate error scenarios by providing corrupted images and check error handling.

## Demo Scenarios
### Scenario 1
Load an image containing printed text and verify the output matches the expected text.

### Scenario 2
Load an image with handwritten text and evaluate the recognition accuracy.

### Scenario 3
Demonstrate the system's ability to handle different image formats.


## Performance Metrics
- Accuracy rate of text recognition (percentage of correctly recognized text).
- Average processing time per image (in seconds).
- User satisfaction score based on feedback.
- Number of successful conversions per hour.

## Success Indicators
- Achieving at least 90% accuracy in text recognition.
- Processing images within 5 seconds.
- User satisfaction ratings above 80%.

## Expected Outputs
- Text output files containing recognized text from images.
- Log files detailing processing steps and any errors encountered.

## Troubleshooting
**No images found**: Ensure images are placed in the 'data' directory.
**Import errors**: Check if all dependencies are installed correctly.
**Slow processing**: Verify the image size and format; consider resizing images.
