# PoC Design Document

## Architecture Overview
The OCR image recognition system consists of a command-line application that processes images to extract text using machine learning models. The architecture includes an image input module, an OCR processing module, and an output module that displays or saves the recognized text. The system is designed to handle various image formats and provides logging for error handling and performance monitoring.

## System Components
- Image Input Module
- OCR Processing Module
- Output Module
- Logging and Error Handling Module

## Technology Stack


## Data Flow
Images are loaded from the filesystem, processed by the OCR module using a pre-trained model, and the recognized text is output to the console or saved to a file. The system logs processing times and errors for monitoring.

## Implementation Phases
1. Phase 1: Setup Development Environment
2. Phase 2: Implement Image Input Module
3. Phase 3: Implement OCR Processing Module
4. Phase 4: Implement Output Module
5. Phase 5: Implement Logging and Error Handling
6. Phase 6: Testing and Validation
7. Phase 7: Documentation and Demonstration

## Performance Requirements
- accuracy: At least 90% text recognition accuracy
- processing_time: Under 5 seconds per image

## Demo Scenarios
- Load a sample image and display recognized text
- Process multiple images in a batch and save outputs
- Demonstrate error handling with invalid image formats

## Success Criteria
- Achieve at least 90% accuracy in text recognition
- Process images within 5 seconds
- Receive user satisfaction ratings above 80%
- Number of successful conversions per hour
