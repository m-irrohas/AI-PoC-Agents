    "reasoning": "The OCR system functions as intended, achieving a high accuracy rate of 95% in text recognition, well above the 90% target. The code is modular, with clear separation of concerns across different modules (input, OCR processing, output, logging). Performance metrics indicate an average processing time of 0.5 seconds per image, which is significantly faster than the 5-second requirement. Error handling is implemented effectively, with logging capturing processing details and errors. However, the system could benefit from additional testing scenarios to ensure robustness under various conditions.",
