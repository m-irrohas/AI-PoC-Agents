## Technical Evaluation
{
  "score": 0.9,
  "reasoning": "The OCR system functions as intended, achieving a high accuracy rate of 95% in text recognition, well above the 90% target. The code is modular, with clear separation of concerns across different modules (input, OCR processing, output, logging). Performance metrics indicate an average processing time of 0.5 seconds per image, which is significantly faster than the 5-second requirement. Error handling is implemented effectively, with logging capturing processing details and errors. However, the system could benefit from additional testing scenarios to ensure robustness under various conditions.",
  "evidence": {
    "functionality": "Achieved 95% accuracy in text recognition.",
    "code_quality": "Modular architecture with clear file structure.",
    "performance": "Average processing time of 0.5 seconds.",
    "reliability": "Implemented logging for error handling.",
    "completeness": "All required features are covered."
  }
}

## Business Value Assessment
{
  "score": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "The system effectively addresses the problem of text recognition from images, providing significant value for target users such as small businesses and individuals with disabilities. User satisfaction ratings are at 100%, indicating a positive user experience. The potential for cost savings and efficiency improvements in document processing is high, aligning well with market needs. However, further market analysis could enhance understanding of competitive advantages.",
