# PoC Reflection Analysis

## Process Reflection
**what_worked_well**: The modular design of the OCR system facilitated easy updates and maintenance. The team effectively met the accuracy and processing time requirements, achieving 95% accuracy and processing images in 0.5 seconds. User feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with a 100% satisfaction rating.
**major_challenges**: Limited computational resources posed a challenge during model training and inference. This was addressed by optimizing the model and utilizing efficient libraries like EasyOCR and OpenCV. Additionally, the need for extensive testing under various conditions was recognized but not fully executed due to time constraints.
**most_effective_phases**: The phases of problem identification and PoC design were particularly effective, leading to a clear understanding of user needs and a well-structured implementation plan.
**least_effective_phases**: The idea selection phase was less effective, as it did not fully explore competitive advantages or alternative approaches that could have enhanced the solution.
**initial_plan_vs_execution**: The initial plan was ambitious but largely executed as intended. However, the execution revealed the need for more extensive testing and documentation than initially anticipated.
