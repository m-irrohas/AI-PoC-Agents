# PoC Reflection Analysis

## Process Reflection
**what_worked_well**: The modular architecture and clear separation of concerns facilitated maintainability and ease of debugging. The team effectively utilized EasyOCR for multilingual support, which was a key innovation.
**major_challenges**: Limited computational resources constrained model training and inference capabilities. Addressing multilingual support was challenging due to time constraints.
**most_effective_phases**: The design and execution phases were highly effective, with clear objectives and successful implementation.
**least_effective_phases**: The idea selection phase was less effective, as it did not fully explore alternative OCR technologies that could have provided better performance.
**initial_plan_vs_execution**: The initial plan was ambitious but largely met. However, the execution fell short in terms of multilingual support and user interface design.
