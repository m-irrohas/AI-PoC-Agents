    "reasoning": "The OCR system functions as intended, successfully processing images and extracting text with a high accuracy rate of 95%. The code is well-structured, following best practices with clear separation of concerns across modules. Performance metrics indicate an average processing time of 0.5 seconds per image, which is well within the requirement of under 5 seconds. Error handling is implemented effectively, with logging capturing processing details and errors. However, the completeness of features could be improved, particularly in multilingual support and handling various image qualities.",
