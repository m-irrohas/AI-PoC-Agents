# PoC Execution Plan

## Setup Steps
1. Ensure Docker is installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository containing the OCR PoC code.
3. Navigate to the code directory where the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are located.
4. Create a directory named 'data' to store input images.
5. Place sample images in the 'data' directory for testing.

## Installation Commands
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

## Execution Commands
1. Run the main script using: python main.py
2. Check the output directory for generated text files.

## Validation Tests
- Test with various image formats (PNG, JPEG, BMP).
- Validate OCR accuracy by comparing output text with known text.
- Measure processing time for each image and ensure it is under 5 seconds.
- Test multilingual support with images containing different languages.

## Demo Scenarios
### Scenario 1
Process a single image and display the output text file.

### Scenario 2
Batch process multiple images and show the results in a summary format.

### Scenario 3
Demonstrate the system's ability to handle different image formats.


## Performance Metrics
- OCR accuracy rate (percentage of correctly recognized characters).
- Average processing time per image (in seconds).
- User engagement metrics (number of processed images, frequency of use).
- Error rate in text output (number of errors per processed image).

## Success Indicators
- Achieving at least 90% accuracy in text recognition.
- Processing each image in under 5 seconds.
- Positive user feedback during usability testing.
- Low error rate in the generated text outputs.

## Expected Outputs
- Text files generated in the output directory for each processed image.
- Log files containing processing details and any errors encountered.
- Performance metrics summary after processing.

## Troubleshooting
**Common Issue**: OCR accuracy is low.
**Solution**: Ensure images are clear and of good quality; consider preprocessing steps to enhance image quality.
