# PoC Design Document

## Architecture Overview
The OCR image recognition system consists of a command-line interface that accepts image files, processes them using a pre-trained OCR model, and outputs the recognized text. The system is designed to handle various image formats and supports multilingual text recognition.

## System Components
- Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- Image Preprocessing Module
- OCR Processing Module
- Post-Processing Module
- Logging and Error Handling Module

## Technology Stack


## Data Flow
The user uploads an image through the CLI. The image is preprocessed to enhance quality, then passed to the OCR Processing Module, which uses a pre-trained model to extract text. The extracted text is post-processed for formatting and output to the user. Logs are generated throughout the process for monitoring and error handling.

## Implementation Phases
1. Phase 1: Setup Development Environment
2. Phase 2: Implement Image Preprocessing Module
3. Phase 3: Implement OCR Processing Module
4. Phase 4: Implement Post-Processing Module
5. Phase 5: Implement Logging and Error Handling
6. Phase 6: Testing and Validation
7. Phase 7: Documentation and Demo Preparation

## Performance Requirements
- accuracy: At least 90% text recognition accuracy
- processing_time: Under 5 seconds per image

## Demo Scenarios
- User uploads a scanned document image and receives the extracted text.
- User uploads an image with handwritten text and evaluates the accuracy of the output.

## Success Criteria
- Achieve at least 90% accuracy in text recognition
- Process images within 5 seconds
- Positive user feedback on usability and functionality
