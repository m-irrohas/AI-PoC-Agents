# PoC Implementation

## Overview
This is a Proof of Concept implementation for the specified project.

## Architecture
The OCR image recognition system consists of a command-line interface that accepts image files, processes them using a pre-trained OCR model, and outputs the recognized text. The system is designed to handle various image formats and supports multilingual text recognition.

## Technology Stack
- Programming Languages: 
- Frameworks: 
- Dependencies: Pillow==8.4.0, EasyOCR==1.4.1, NumPy==1.21.2, OpenCV-Python==4.5.3.20210927

- `ocr_processing.py`: Implementation file
- `post_processing.py`: Implementation file
- `requirements.txt`: Implementation file
- `README.md`: Implementation file
- `docker-compose.yml`: Implementation file

## Setup Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Install Python dependencies (if applicable)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Install Node.js dependencies (if applicable)  
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configuration**
   - Copy configuration templates
   - Update environment variables
   - Initialize database/storage if needed

3. **Execution**
   ```bash
   # Run main application
   python main.py
   
   # Or for web applications
   npm start
   ```

## Testing
```bash
# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/
```

## Demo Scenarios
- User uploads a scanned document image and receives the extracted text.
- User uploads an image with handwritten text and evaluates the accuracy of the output.
